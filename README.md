# Arduino-Based Random number generator


The simplest and most effective gift for a Teacher:
They have a problem to choose a student for question and select it randomly,
at boot the board generate a sequence of number that must be the number of students in classroom.
this number is declared by variable on sketch.
the sequence is plotted before on serialmonitor, but on display looks like random numbers was generated in real time!
Have fun.
